However, as both Cher and Robyn are pop artists, I anticipate that their lexical diversity scores will be somewhat similar.Pop music is known for its repetitive and simple lyrics, which can lead to lower lexical diversity scores. While both artists are in the pop genre, Cher's style incorporates elements of country and is geared towards older audiences, whereas Robyn's style is more contemporary and aimed at a younger audience. Given this, it is not surprising that Cher may have a slightly lower lexical diversity score due to the simplicity and repetition present in country music. Overall, the similarities in the lexical diversity scores are to be expected as both artists are in the same genre, pop.\n"
